# 8-Ball-Machine
8 Ball is literally a black ball used in the game of billiards when pocketed marks the end of a game. However the script here refers to the <i>Magic 8 Ball</i> which is a device used to seek advice and fortune telling for children's entertainment puproses. The Physical Magic 8 Ball contains a 20 sided polyhedron with certain phrases written on each face floating in Liquid inside the Magic Ball which when turned displays a certain face containing the phrase often turned after asking a question.<br>

This Script contains around 3 times the amount of phrases present in a physical Magic Ball to make it more interesting.
